Before html5 for header , body and footer
 we were use div 
 example:
 <div>
    <div id="header"></div>
    <div id="body"></div>
    <div id="footer"></div>
 </div>

 above one is known as non semantic tag

 But in html5 we got some features like for header we can use  like <header></header> that one is known as semantic tags

 example of semantic tags : <header/> <footer/><aside/> <section/>


//Meta tags
